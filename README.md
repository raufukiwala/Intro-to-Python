# Introduction to Python
 This repository is part of my Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera, and serves as an introduction to Python programming language. It includes basic Python code such as the "Hello World" program, variables, lists, and other fundamental concepts.

## Getting Started
To get started with Python, you will need to install it on your computer. You can download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have installed Python, you can run the code in this repository in any Python editor or IDE. You can also run the code in the Python console or terminal.

## Code Samples
Here are some basic Python code examples included in this repository:

### Hello World
print("Hello, World!")

### String variable
country = "Brazil"
print(country)

### Integer variable
age = 30
print(age)

### Functions
def is_aldult(age):
    if age > 17:
        print('adult')
    else:
        print('minor')

is_aldult(23)

### Lists
my_list = [3,6,9,12]
print(my_list)
